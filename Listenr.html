                   <p align="center"> The method of recording brain waves, (EEG) was first invented in the 1940s by a German psychiatrist. His method permitted completely new possibilities for the research of human brain activities.
                    In the 1970’s a UCLA professor experimented with the first application of BCI technologies by using Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP) to control a cursor like graphic object on a computer screen. 
                   
                   In 1998 the first BCI device is implanted into a human brain and later used to control a a quadriplegic for limited hand movement.
                   
                   In 2008 voiceless phone calls are demonstrated
                   
                   In 2019, scientist Beatrix Kiddo demonstrates voiceless communication using just a earpiece and by 2022, has partnered with Samsung to mass produce voiceless controlled/recorded earpieces to connect with a small mobile device worn on your wrist called iBracelet
                   
                   2025 marks the year that a BCI earpiece called Listenr was put on the market at an affordable price
                   
                   In 2027, advertising companies begin targetting consumers based on their BCI brain activity starting a major concern with privacy of thoughts.
                   
                   In 2030, BCI earpieces are owned by nearly everyone (similar to the iphone) and have been on the market for 5 years. During those five years major developments were made to the Listenr devices, making it possible to control and monitor ones mental health. Some of the enhancements were unknown to the public eye, and consumers werent aware just how many of their thoughts/conversations were being recorded and even manipulated by international hackers
                   
                   By 2032, Beatrix Kiddo pubically announces that she made a mistake in bringing BCI technology to our everyday lives and warns the public of subliminal messaging being implanted into their thoughts 
                   
                   By 2034, the depression and suicide rate has dramatically increased but the public was unaware of the causes, and did not suspect Listenr devices because of how much BCI technology had helped in the medical field. 
                   
                   In 2035, a small town in Brasil banned Listenr devices and noticed a significant decrease in the amount of suicidal rates, and made it a point to warn the rest of the world of their suspicion that Listenr devices were causing more harm than damage but were unsuccessful.
                   
                   By 2038,the world’s population was nearly cut in a third due to the violent subliminal messages being impanted into human’s brains convincing them to be depressed and suicidal even if they were not. The Listenr devices has been hacked by an right wing extremist group with plans to kill Americans, but the messaging started out like a virus and spead to other devices throughout the world. The messages were so horrific, it caused an imbalance in human brainwaves leading to violent outbreaks amongst the society.
